# 100-Days-of-Python-Code
My journey to learning python through building projects.

This repository contains my daily projects and exercises from Angela Yu’s "100 Days of Python" course.
I do code in VS-code and upload almost daily here on github.

## Progress
✅ Completed up to Day 4

## Structure
Each folder in this repository represents one day and contains:
- a README.md file (for overview and concepts)
- Python source files
- Other files needed for the project
